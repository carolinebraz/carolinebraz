### About me

<div align="justify">
  <p>
  My name is Caroline, but people usually call me Carol. I'm passionate about technology and enjoy activities that stimulate imagination and logical reasoning.
  </p>
  <p>	
  I learned programming during college when I wrote my first lines of code in <a href="https://www.scilab.org/">Scilab</a>. Driven by curiosity, I started studying HTML, CSS, and JS through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> tutorials. 
  </p>
  <p> 
  After a few years, I participated in training at Gama Academy where I had contact with C#/.NET and Angular. In the Generation bootcamp, I developed projects in Java/Spring and React.
  </p>
  <p>
  I don't fit into the gamer category, but my favorite game is Portal. I'm also a fan of the classic games TLoZ: OoT :crossed_swords: and SM64 :mushroom:. Currently, the only games I'm involved in are family UNO matches.
  </p>
  <p>
  I'm a book lover, sometimes a writer (when inspired), and a cat mom. :book: :pencil: :black_cat:
